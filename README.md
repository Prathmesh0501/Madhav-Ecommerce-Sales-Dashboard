## üßæ Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and monitor key sales and profit metrics for Madhav Ecommerce. The data was extracted, cleaned, and modeled using SQL, and visualized in Power BI to deliver actionable business insights.

## üè¢ Business Context
Madhav Ecommerce is a growing Indian retail brand offering products across categories like clothing, electronics, and furniture. With increasing data volume and operational complexity, the company needed a centralized system to track performance and uncover growth opportunities.
By adopting a data-driven approach, Madhav Ecommerce aims to improve revenue, reduce losses, and optimize category-wise sales through meaningful analytics.

## ‚ùóBusiness Problem
- Profit margins were inconsistent across months and sub-categories.
- Leadership lacked visibility into top-performing customers, states, and payment modes.
- High dependency on Cash on Delivery (COD) led to operational inefficiencies.
- The company needed a dashboard to track KPIs over time and support data-backed decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

## üìà Dashboard Highlights
